#
# Recommended order:
# 1. 01-checks.yaml    - Verify SSH, become access, firewall, ports
# 2. 02-certs.yaml     - Generate and distribute TLS certificates  
# 3. 03-monitoring.yaml - Deploy monitoring stack (Prometheus, Grafana, Loki)
# 4. 04-jellyfin.yaml  - Jellyfin deployment pre-checks and storage validation
# 5. site.yaml         - Full site orchestrator (includes kubernetes_stack.yaml)
#
# You can also run individual deployment playbooks:
# - ansible/plays/kubernetes_stack.yaml (main Kubernetes stack)
# - ansible/plays/jellyfin.yml (Jellyfin media server)
