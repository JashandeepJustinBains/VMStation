# VMStation Monitoring Stack Implementation Summary

## Overview
This implementation delivers a comprehensive, production-ready monitoring and observability stack for the VMStation Kubernetes homelab cluster, fully aligned with the deployment specification.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Core Monitoring Manifests
Created complete, production-ready Kubernetes manifests in `manifests/monitoring/`:

#### Prometheus (`prometheus.yaml`)
- **Namespace & RBAC**: ServiceAccount, ClusterRole, ClusterRoleBinding
- **ConfigMap**: Comprehensive scrape configurations + alerting rules
- **Deployment**: Single replica on control plane with resource limits
- **Service**: NodePort 30090 for external access

**Key Features**:
- 7 scrape configurations (API server, nodes, cAdvisor, node-exporter, kube-state-metrics, pods, services)
- 9 alerting rules across 3 groups (apps, nodes, node-exporter)
- 30-day metric retention
- Alert rules for pod crashes, node health, resource usage

#### Grafana (`grafana.yaml`)
- **ConfigMaps**: Datasources (Prometheus + Loki) and dashboard providers
- **Deployment**: Single replica with Loki datasource pre-configured
- **Service**: NodePort 30300 for external access
- **Credentials**: admin/admin (documented to change in production)

**Key Features**:
- Pre-configured Prometheus and Loki datasources
- Dashboard provider for automatic loading
- Persistent storage via emptyDir (upgradeable to PV)

#### Loki (`loki.yaml`)
- **ConfigMap**: Loki configuration (auth, storage, schema)
- **Deployment**: Single replica on control plane
- **Service**: NodePort 31100 for external access

**Key Features**:
- Centralized log aggregation
- BoltDB-shipper storage backend
- Filesystem-based object storage
- Ready for Grafana integration

#### Node Exporter (`node-exporter.yaml`)
- **ServiceAccount**: Dedicated RBAC
- **DaemonSet**: Runs on all nodes with hostNetwork/hostPID
- **Service**: ClusterIP with Prometheus annotations

**Key Features**:
- System-level metrics from all nodes
- CPU, memory, disk, network metrics
- Excludes virtual/temporary filesystems
- Security context (non-root user 65534)

#### Kube State Metrics (`kube-state-metrics.yaml`)
- **ServiceAccount + RBAC**: Comprehensive ClusterRole for K8s objects
- **Deployment**: Single replica on control plane
- **Service**: ClusterIP with Prometheus annotations

**Key Features**:
- Kubernetes object state metrics
- Pod, deployment, node, service metrics
- Resource quota and capacity metrics
- Security-hardened deployment

### 2. Grafana Dashboards
Created 4 comprehensive, production-ready dashboards in `ansible/files/grafana_dashboards/`:

#### Kubernetes Cluster Overview (`kubernetes-cluster-dashboard.json`)
- **UID**: `k8s-cluster-dash`
- **Panels**: 9 panels showing cluster health
  - Stats: Total nodes, nodes ready, total pods, pods running
  - Timeseries: Node CPU/memory, pod distribution, network traffic
- **Use Case**: Primary cluster health dashboard

#### Node Metrics (`node-dashboard.json`)
- **UID**: `node-dash`
- **Panels**: 4 detailed system metrics panels
  - CPU usage per instance
  - Memory usage per instance
  - Disk usage per instance
  - Network I/O (rx/tx) per interface
- **Use Case**: Detailed node performance analysis

#### Prometheus Metrics (`prometheus-dashboard.json`)
- **UID**: `prom-dash`
- **Panels**: 7 panels for Prometheus monitoring
  - Stats: Instances, targets up/down, time series count
  - Timeseries: HTTP request rate, query duration (p50/p95/p99)
- **Use Case**: Prometheus health and performance monitoring

#### Loki Logs (`loki-dashboard.json`)
- **UID**: `loki-dash`
- **Panels**: 3 log analysis panels
  - Kubernetes system logs (live view)
  - Monitoring stack logs (live view)
  - Log rate by namespace (timeseries)
- **Use Case**: Centralized log viewing and analysis

### 3. Ansible Playbook Updates
Completely refactored `ansible/plays/deploy-apps.yaml`:

**Changes**:

**Benefits**:
- Cleaner, more maintainable code
- Separation of concerns (config in manifests, orchestration in playbook)
- Easier to version control and update
- Consistent with Kubernetes best practices

### 4. Documentation

**Sections**:
1. Overview and Architecture
2. Component descriptions (5 components)
3. Prometheus configuration details
4. Alerting rules documentation
5. Grafana dashboard descriptions
6. Deployment procedures (auto, manual, ansible)
