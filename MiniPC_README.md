Absolutely! Here's a clean, professional-style documentation section you can include in your mini PC setup guide. I‚Äôve added some extra context and best practices to make it robust and future-proof.

# Mini PC - Monitoring Node

The Mini PC serves as the monitoring node for the network. It runs Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, and other monitoring tools to visualize the network and system metrics on a web dashboard.

## Features
- **Prometheus**: Collects metrics from all devices.
- **Grafana**: Visualizes metrics and logs.
- **Loki**: Centralized logging for the network.
- **Headless Debian**: Lightweight OS for efficient resource usage.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Install Base System Utilities**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
   sudo apt install -y openssh-server net-tools htop tmux git curl wget ufw fail2ban
   ```

2. **Install Monitoring Tools**:
   - Install Prometheus, Grafana, and Loki using Ansible playbooks:
     ```bash
     ansible-playbook -i inventory.txt ansible/plays/deploy_apps_with_helm.yaml
     ```

3. **Access the Dashboard**:
   - Grafana: `http://<MiniPC_IP>:32000`
   - Prometheus: `http://<MiniPC_IP>:32001`

4. **Firewall Configuration**:
   ```bash
   sudo ufw allow ssh
   sudo ufw allow 32000/tcp  # Grafana
   sudo ufw allow 32001/tcp  # Prometheus
   sudo ufw enable
   ```

## Notes
- Ensure the Mini PC has a static IP address.
- Use the `TODO.md` file for pending tasks.

## üñß Serial Console Access via Mini PC

This section documents how to use the mini PC to access the serial console of network devices (e.g., switches, routers) via the management interface using `minicom`.

---

### üì¶ Requirements

- Mini PC running Linux (Debian/Ubuntu-based)
- USB-to-Serial adapter (e.g., FTDI, Prolific)
- Console cable (RJ45-to-DB9 or USB, depending on device)
- Installed package: `minicom`

---

### üîå Physical Setup

1. Connect the USB-to-Serial adapter to the mini PC.
2. Plug the console cable into the management port of the target device.
3. Confirm the device powers on and is ready for console access.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Software Installation

Install `minicom` if not already present:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install minicom
```

---

### üîç Identify Serial Interface

Run the following to detect the serial device:
```bash
dmesg | grep tty
```

Look for entries like `/dev/ttyUSB0` or `/dev/ttyS0`.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configure Minicom

Launch configuration:
```bash
sudo minicom -s
```

In the setup menu:

- **Serial port setup**:
  - Serial device: `/dev/ttyUSB0` (or detected device)
  - Baud rate: `9600` (common for Cisco; try `115200` if needed)
  - Data bits: `8`
  - Parity: `None`
  - Stop bits: `1`
  - Flow control: `None` (disable both hardware and software)

Save settings and exit to launch.

---

### üöÄ Launch Console Session

Start `minicom`:
```bash
sudo minicom
```

You should see the device‚Äôs console output. Press `Enter` to wake the prompt if needed.

To exit `minicom`, press `Ctrl-A`, then `X`.

---

### üß™ Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| No output | Try different baud rates (`115200`, `38400`) |
| Permission denied | Add user to `dialout` group: `sudo usermod -aG dialout $USER` |
| Device not detected | Replug USB adapter and recheck `dmesg` |
| Garbled text | Confirm baud rate and disable flow control |

---

### üßæ Best Practices & Notes

- **Label your cables**: Especially if managing multiple devices.
- **Keep a backup of minicom config**: Use `~/.minirc.dfl` for persistent settings.
- **Log sessions**: Use `minicom -C <filename>` to capture output for audits or troubleshooting.
- **Secure access**: Only allow trusted users to access serial interfaces.
- **Use screen as an alternative**: `screen /dev/ttyUSB0 9600` is a quick fallback if `minicom` misbehaves.
