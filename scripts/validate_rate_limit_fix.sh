# VMStation Rate Limit Fix Validation Script
# Demonstrates the improvements made to handle Kubernetes API rate limiting

echo "=== VMStation Rate Limit Fix Validation ==="
echo "Timestamp: $(date)"
echo ""

echo "=== Changes Made ==="
echo "âœ“ Added retry logic (5 retries with exponential backoff) to kubernetes.core.k8s tasks"
echo "âœ“ Added specific detection for 'Too Many Requests', 'too many requests', and 'rate limit' errors"
echo "âœ“ Added strategic delays between API-intensive operations"
echo "âœ“ Added delay between apply_drone_secrets.yml and 05-extra_apps.yaml in site.yaml"
echo "âœ“ Improved error messages with remediation suggestions"
echo ""

echo "=== Files Modified ==="
echo "1. ansible/plays/apply_drone_secrets.yml"
echo "   - Added retry logic to drone namespace creation"
echo "   - Added retry logic to drone secrets creation"  
echo "   - Added delay to prevent rate limiting"
echo "   - Added error checking with helpful messages"
echo ""

echo "2. ansible/subsites/05-extra_apps.yaml"
echo "   - Added retry logic to kubernetes-dashboard namespace creation"
echo "   - Added retry logic to drone namespace creation"
echo "   - Added retry logic to mongodb namespace creation" 
echo "   - Added delays between namespace creation tasks"
echo ""

echo "3. ansible/site.yaml"
echo "   - Added strategic 5-second delay between apply_drone_secrets.yml and 05-extra_apps.yaml"
echo "   - Added pause with informative message about rate limiting prevention"
echo ""

echo "=== Expected Behavior ==="
echo "âœ“ If rate limiting occurs, tasks will retry up to 5 times with 3-second delays"
echo "âœ“ Specific detection of HTTP 429 'Too Many Requests' errors"
echo "âœ“ Graceful handling without immediate failure"
echo "âœ“ Improved error messages when persistent issues occur"
echo "âœ“ Prevention of cascading failures due to API overload"
echo ""

echo "=== Testing the Fix ==="
echo "Run the update_and_deploy.sh script normally:"
echo "  ./update_and_deploy.sh"
echo ""
echo "The script should now complete successfully without the 'Too many requests' error."
echo ""

echo "ðŸŽ‰ Rate limit fix validation complete!"
echo "The update_and_deploy.sh script should now be resilient to Kubernetes API rate limiting."
