# VMStation Monitoring Manifests Configuration
# Created during manifest reorganization - 2025-10-09
#
# This variable defines the base path for monitoring manifests.
# After reorganization, manifests are split into platform-specific directories:
#   - manifests/debian-bookworm/ (control-plane nodes)
#   - manifests/rhel10/ (compute/homelab nodes)
#
# For backward compatibility and to support the current deployment model where
# the operator resets the cluster for each deployment, we maintain a single
# manifests directory path variable.

# Primary manifest directory (default: monitoring manifests location)
# This should point to the directory containing manifest files on the deployment host
monitoring_manifests_dir: "/srv/monitoring_data/VMStation/manifests/monitoring"

# Platform-specific manifest directories (for future use)
# Uncomment and use these when deploying to specific platforms:
# monitoring_manifests_debian_dir: "/srv/monitoring_data/VMStation/manifests/debian-bookworm"
# monitoring_manifests_rhel_dir: "/srv/monitoring_data/VMStation/manifests/rhel10"

# Alternative paths for different deployment scenarios:
# Local development/testing:
# monitoring_manifests_dir: "{{ playbook_dir }}/../../manifests/monitoring"
#
# Platform-specific deployment:
# monitoring_manifests_dir: "{{ playbook_dir }}/../../manifests/{{ target_platform | default('debian-bookworm') }}"
