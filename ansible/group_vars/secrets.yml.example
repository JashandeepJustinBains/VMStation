# VMStation Secrets Template for ansible-vault
# This file shows the structure and variable names for secrets that should be encrypted.
# 
# To create the actual secrets file:
# ansible-vault create ansible/group_vars/secrets.yml
#
# Add these variables with real values (encrypted):

# === Grafana Admin Password ===
# Default admin password for Grafana web interface
grafana_admin_pass: "your_secure_grafana_password"

# === Quay Registry Credentials (Optional) ===
# Container registry credentials for pulling private images
quay_username: "your_quay_username"
quay_password: "your_quay_password"

# === Samba/File Sharing Password ===
# Password for Samba file sharing services
samba_password: "your_samba_password"

# === Sudo Password for R430 Node ===
# Sudo password for the R430 compute node automation
vault_r430_sudo_password: "your_r430_sudo_password"

# === Usage Instructions ===
# 1. Create encrypted secrets file:
#    ansible-vault create ansible/group_vars/secrets.yml
# 
# 2. Add the variables above with real values
#
# 3. Set ansible_become_pass in all.yml to reference the vaulted password:
#    ansible_become_pass: "{{ vault_r430_sudo_password }}"
#
# 4. Use vault password file or prompt during playbook runs:
#    ansible-playbook -i inventory.txt --ask-vault-pass playbook.yml
#    # OR
#    echo "your_vault_password" > ~/.vault_pass.txt
#    ansible-playbook -i inventory.txt --vault-password-file ~/.vault_pass.txt playbook.yml
#
# === Security Notes ===
# - Never commit this file with real passwords
# - Keep vault password secure and separate from repository
# - Rotate passwords regularly
# - Use strong, unique passwords for each service
