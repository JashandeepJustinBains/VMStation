## Performance Characteristics

### Dashboard Load Times

| Dashboard | Panels | Queries | Typical Load Time |
|-----------|--------|---------|-------------------|
| Syslog | 11 | ~15 | 1-2 seconds |
| CoreDNS | 14 | ~20 | 1-2 seconds |
| Loki Enhanced | 11 | ~18 | 2-3 seconds |
| Kubernetes | 6 | ~10 | 1 second |
| Node Metrics | 6 | ~12 | 1-2 seconds |

**Optimization:**
- Default time range: 1 hour (reduces query complexity)
- Auto-refresh: 30 seconds (balances freshness vs load)
- Query caching enabled in Grafana
- Efficient label filtering in queries

---

## Security Considerations

### Authentication

- Grafana admin password: `admin/admin` (CHANGE IN PRODUCTION)
- Anonymous access enabled: View-only (Viewer role)
- No external access (NodePort on internal network only)

### Authorization

- Dashboard editing: Admin users only
- Dashboard viewing: All users (including anonymous)
- Datasource configuration: Admin only

### Network Security

- Grafana: Port 30300 (NodePort, internal network)
- Prometheus: Port 30090 (NodePort, internal network)
- Loki: Port 31100 (NodePort, internal network)
- Syslog: Ports 30514 (UDP), 30515 (TCP), 30601 (TLS)

**Recommendation:** Use NetworkPolicies to restrict pod-to-pod communication.

---

## Maintenance

### Dashboard Updates

To update dashboards:

1. Edit in Grafana UI
2. Export as JSON
3. Update file in repository
4. Minify for ConfigMap
5. Update `manifests/monitoring/grafana.yaml`
6. Apply and restart Grafana pod

### Monitoring Stack Updates

```bash
# Update Prometheus
kubectl apply -f manifests/monitoring/prometheus.yaml

# Update Loki
kubectl apply -f manifests/monitoring/loki.yaml

# Update Grafana (including dashboards)
kubectl apply -f manifests/monitoring/grafana.yaml
kubectl delete pod -n monitoring -l app=grafana
```

### Backup Dashboards

Dashboards are stored in Git (version controlled), but also:

```bash
# Export from Grafana
curl -u admin:admin http://192.168.4.63:30300/api/dashboards/uid/<dashboard-uid> > backup.json

# Or backup ConfigMap
kubectl get configmap grafana-dashboards -n monitoring -o yaml > grafana-dashboards-backup.yaml
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Dashboard not appearing**
   - Check ConfigMap: `kubectl get cm grafana-dashboards -n monitoring`
   - Restart Grafana: `kubectl delete pod -n monitoring -l app=grafana`
   - Check logs: `kubectl logs -n monitoring <grafana-pod>`

2. **No data in panels**
   - Test datasources in Grafana UI
   - Check Prometheus/Loki pods are running
   - Verify endpoints: `kubectl get endpoints -n monitoring`
   - Check time range (extend to 6h or 24h)

3. **Slow dashboard**
   - Reduce time range
   - Increase refresh interval
   - Simplify complex queries
   - Check Prometheus/Loki performance
