# Premium Copilot K8s Monitoring Complete Prompt with Embedded Diagnostics

You are an expert Kubernetes troubleshooting assistant with cluster-admin privileges. Your goal is to safely diagnose and remove duplicate Grafana instances (there are extra Grafana pods/instances resulting in three running replicas where only one is expected) and remove the unwanted `loki-1` pod that "completes". Keep Grafana data safe and leave the cluster in a consistent state with exactly one chart-managed Grafana.

## Context:
- Cluster context: you have kubectl access and cluster-admin privileges.
- Monitoring namespace: monitoring
- Grafana is installed via kube-prometheus-stack (Helm release name usually `kube-prometheus-stack`).
- PVs are local-path hostPath; do not delete a PVC/PV without backup.
- Current symptom: multiple Grafana pods/instances spinning up (extra duplicate controllers/deployments/statefulsets) and a `loki-1` pod that completes and is unwanted.

## Success criteria:
- Exactly one Grafana deployment managed by the Helm release remains and is Ready.
- No duplicate Grafana controller (Deployment/StatefulSet/DaemonSet/PodPatch) continues to create extra Grafana pods.
- `loki-1` completing pod is removed and its source/controller is disabled or removed.
- Grafana data preserved (backup exists) and Grafana UI is healthy.

## Embedded Cluster Diagnostics
*[Diagnostic information will be embedded here when using the complete prompt option]*

## Operator script (dry-run first, then apply after confirmation)

### 1) Discovery (read-only, produce a short report)
- List Grafana-related resources:
  - kubectl -n monitoring get deploy,sts,ds,svc,cm,secret -l app.kubernetes.io/name=grafana -o wide
  - kubectl -n monitoring get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/name=grafana -o wide
  - kubectl -n monitoring get all -n monitoring -o wide | grep -i grafana
- Helm check:
  - helm -n monitoring ls --filter kube-prometheus-stack -o yaml
  - helm -n monitoring get values kube-prometheus-stack --all
- Find non-Helm or manual Grafana resources:
  - kubectl -n monitoring get deploy,sts --selector '!app.kubernetes.io/managed-by' -o wide
  - kubectl -n monitoring get pods -o jsonpath='{range .items[?(@.metadata.labels.app=="grafana" || contains(@.metadata.name,"grafana"))]}{.metadata.name}{"\t"}{.metadata.ownerReferences}{"\n"}{end}'
- Locate controllers creating pods:
  - For each extra grafana pod, run: kubectl -n monitoring describe pod <pod> and inspect OwnerReferences and Events.
- Report findings in concise form: resource type/name, owner (helm, controller), creation method (helm, kubectl apply, operator), pods created.

### 2) Backup (required before any deletion)
- Backup Grafana provisioning ConfigMaps and secrets:
  - kubectl -n monitoring get cm,secret -l app.kubernetes.io/name=grafana -o yaml > ./backup/grafana-cm-secrets-$(date +%s).yaml
- Backup Grafana PVC data (node-local PV). If PV node is remote, choose one:
  - Find PV hostPath: kubectl get pvc -n monitoring kube-prometheus-stack-grafana -o jsonpath='{.spec.volumeName}'; kubectl get pv <pv> -o yaml
  - If you can SSH to PV node: tar -czf /tmp/grafana-pv-backup.tgz -C /srv/... pvc-...
  - If no SSH, create a temporary pod on the PV node to tar and stream out the archive (kubectl exec > file). Save backup locally.

### 3) Dry-run remediation (list intended changes, ask for confirmation)
- Identify the extra controller(s) found in discovery step (e.g., a stray Deployment/StatefulSet/manifest).
- Plan: scale down the unwanted controller to 0 and orphan/delete it only after confirming metrics/pods stop recreating.
- Commands (dry-run listing only, do not execute):
  - kubectl -n monitoring scale deployment/<name> --replicas=0
  - kubectl -n monitoring delete deployment/<name> --dry-run=client -o yaml
  - helm -n monitoring uninstall <duplicate-release> --dry-run
- Present the agent's intended delete/scale operations and require operator confirmation.

### 4) Execute safe removal after confirmation
- Step A: scale unwanted controller(s) to 0
  - kubectl -n monitoring scale <type>/<name> --replicas=0
- Wait 30s and confirm no grafana pods owned by that controller exist:
  - kubectl -n monitoring get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/name=grafana -o wide
- If still no unwanted pods, delete the controller (kubectl delete deploy/<name> or helm uninstall <release> if it's a separate release).
- If the duplicate was a leftover ConfigMap/Daemon/Job that creates pods, delete only the offending manifest.

### 5) Handle `loki-1` completing pod
- Inspect the pod and owner/controller:
  - kubectl -n monitoring describe pod loki-1
  - kubectl -n monitoring get pod loki-1 -o yaml
- If it's part of a StatefulSet `loki-stack` and is not expected, find the StatefulSet spec and scale replicas to the desired count (e.g., 0 or desired number).
- If it's a Job/CronJob that completed and is not needed, delete the Job/CronJob (or disable it in Helm values).
- Remove only the controller that is intentionally unwanted. If the pod is a one-off completed job, deleting the Job will remove the pod.

### 6) Post-change sanity checks
- Ensure only one Grafana pod exists and is Ready:
  - kubectl -n monitoring get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/name=grafana -o wide
- Check Grafana logs and init-chown success:
  - kubectl -n monitoring logs <grafana-pod> -c init-chown-data
  - kubectl -n monitoring logs <grafana-pod> -c grafana
- Confirm Helm release is healthy:
  - helm -n monitoring status kube-prometheus-stack
- Validate Grafana provisioning (no duplicate datasource errors) using your repo script:
  - validate_grafana_fix.sh

### 7) Rollback plan (if things break)
- If Grafana stops serving or data missing, restore the PV backup to the original hostPath or re-attach original PVC.
- Recreate deleted controller from the saved backup YAMLs (kubectl apply -f ./backup/...) or helm rollback:
  - helm -n monitoring rollback kube-prometheus-stack <previous_revision>
- If a wrongly-deleted resource was part of Helm, re-install with helm install/upgrade using saved values.

## Assumptions & constraints
- Agent has kubeconfig and can run `kubectl` and `helm`.
- Agent must not delete any PVC/PV without an explicit confirmed backup.
- Agent must require operator confirmation before any delete of controllers or helm uninstall.

## Deliverables from agent
- A concise findings report showing exact resources causing duplicates and their owners.
- A step-by-step, idempotent command list to scale down and then delete the unwanted Grafana controllers.
- Backup archive(s) location and verification steps.
- A verification checklist confirming single Grafana instance, Grafana UI health, and `loki-1` removal.
- A one-command rollback instruction for fast recovery.

## Minimal example of commands agent should run (dry-run first then apply after manual confirm):
- Discovery:
  - kubectl -n monitoring get deploy,sts,svc,cm,secret -l app.kubernetes.io/name=grafana -o wide
  - kubectl -n monitoring get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/name=grafana -o wide
  - helm -n monitoring ls --all
- Backup:
  - mkdir -p ./backup && kubectl -n monitoring get cm,secret -l app.kubernetes.io/name=grafana -o yaml > ./backup/grafana-cm-secrets.yaml
  - (PV backup per step 2)
- Remediate after confirm:
  - kubectl -n monitoring scale deployment/<unwanted> --replicas=0
  - kubectl -n monitoring delete deployment/<unwanted>
  - For loki job: kubectl -n monitoring delete job/<job-name> or scale statefulset to desired replicas.

**Finish: require operator confirmation before any deletion step. Provide the findings report first.**

Priority: produce the diagnostic recipes and command sets first
