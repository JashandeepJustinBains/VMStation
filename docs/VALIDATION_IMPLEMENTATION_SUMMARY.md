5. [x] Validate node status and monitoring dashboards (test-complete-validation.sh)
6. [x] Print concise curl status for all monitoring endpoints (all tests)

## Technical Implementation Details

### Test Architecture

- **Modular Design**: Each test script is standalone and can be run independently
- **Progressive Validation**: Tests ordered from non-destructive to destructive
- **User Confirmation**: Destructive tests require explicit user confirmation
- **Exit Codes**: Proper exit codes for CI/CD integration (0 = success, 1 = failure)

### Output Format

All tests follow consistent output format:
- ✅ PASS: for successful tests
- ❌ FAIL: for failed tests
- ⚠️  WARN: for warnings (non-critical issues)
- ℹ️  INFO: for informational messages

### Concise Curl Output

New format implemented across all monitoring tests:
```bash
# Success
curl http://192.168.4.63:30090/-/healthy ok

# Failure
curl http://192.168.4.63:30090/-/healthy error
```

### Script Features

- **Error Handling**: All scripts use `set -euo pipefail` for robust error handling
- **Timeout Protection**: Network operations have timeouts to prevent hanging
- **Logging**: All actions are logged with timestamps
- **Idempotent**: Tests can be run multiple times safely (except sleep/wake cycle)

## Usage Examples

### Quick Validation (Recommended)
```bash
./tests/test-complete-validation.sh
```

### Individual Test Validation
```bash
# Configuration only
./tests/test-autosleep-wake-validation.sh

# Monitoring only
./tests/test-monitoring-exporters-health.sh

# Loki only
./tests/test-loki-validation.sh
```

### CI/CD Integration
```bash
# Safe for automated pipelines (non-destructive tests only)
./tests/test-autosleep-wake-validation.sh
./tests/test-monitoring-exporters-health.sh
./tests/test-loki-validation.sh
./tests/test-monitoring-access.sh
```
