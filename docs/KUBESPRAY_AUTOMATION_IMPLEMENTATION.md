- Configures modules to load on boot
- Ensures persistence across reboots

#### `ansible/playbooks/fixes/restart-container-runtime.yml`
- Restarts containerd service
- Ensures service is enabled
- Waits for containerd socket to be ready

### 5. Testing Infrastructure

#### Test Suite
**File**: `tests/test-kubespray-automation.sh`

Comprehensive validation of automation components:
- Script existence and executability
- Bash syntax validation
- Function presence verification

All tests pass successfully ✅

## Environment Variables

The automation uses standardized environment variables:

```bash
REPO_ROOT=/github/workspace                          # Repository root
KUBESPRAY_DIR=$REPO_ROOT/.cache/kubespray           # Kubespray location
KUBESPRAY_INVENTORY=$KUBESPRAY_DIR/inventory/mycluster/inventory.ini
MAIN_INVENTORY=$REPO_ROOT/ansible/inventory/hosts.yml
SSH_KEY_PATH=/tmp/id_vmstation_ops                   # SSH private key
VMSTATION_SSH_KEY=<secret>                           # SSH key content (from GitHub)
```

## Security Implementation

### SSH Key Management
- Keys stored only in GitHub Secrets
- Written to /tmp with mode 0600
- Never logged or echoed
- Cleanup reminder at end of run

### Kubeconfig Protection
- Stored in /tmp with mode 0600
- Excluded from git via .gitignore
- Available as artifact with 7-day retention
- Not committed to repository

### Backup Safety
- All modified files backed up before changes
- Backups stored in .git/ops-backups/<timestamp>/
- Each backup committed to git history
- Timestamped for easy identification

## Error Handling & Remediation

### Automatic Remediation
The system automatically handles:
- **Python missing**: Installs python3 via package manager
- **Swap enabled**: Disables swap and removes fstab entries
- **Kernel modules**: Loads br_netfilter and overlay
- **Container runtime**: Restarts containerd and kubelet
- **Sleeping nodes**: Sends Wake-on-LAN packets
- **Network issues**: Creates comprehensive diagnostic bundle

### Retry Logic
- Cluster deployment: Up to 3 attempts with remediation
- Inventory validation: 2 attempts with WoL between
- Preflight checks: 2 attempts with remediation

### Fail-Safe Stops
System stops immediately if:
- SSH key is not available
- No network connectivity after WoL attempts
- Cluster deployment fails after all retries
- Kubeconfig is not generated

## Artifacts & Logging

### Log Files
All logs stored in `ansible/artifacts/run-<timestamp>/ansible-run-logs/`:
- `main.log` - Main orchestration log
- `preflight.log` - Preflight check output
- `kubespray-cluster.log` - Cluster deployment log
- `cluster-verification.log` - Verification output
- `monitoring-deployment.log` - Monitoring deployment
- `infrastructure-deployment.log` - Infrastructure deployment
- `smoke-test.log` - Smoke test results

### Reports
- `ops-report-<timestamp>.json` - JSON report with:
  - Timestamp
  - Preflight status
  - Cluster deployment status
  - Node information
  - Artifact locations

### Diagnostic Bundle (on failure)
- `network-diagnostics.txt` - Network connectivity tests
- `ssh-diagnostics.txt` - SSH connection tests
- `inventory-diagnostics.txt` - Inventory validation
- `environment-diagnostics.txt` - Environment details

### Backups
