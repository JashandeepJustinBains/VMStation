# Deployment Script Improvements - Implementation Summary

## Problem Statement
The deployment scripts were using the homelab node in Debian setup and checks, and required interactive confirmations (pressing Enter or typing "y"/"yes") when running playbooks. Additionally, the bash-only outputs were not color-coded.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Homelab from Debian Deployment

**File: `ansible/playbooks/deploy-cluster.yaml`**
- Removed `homelab` from CNI verification loops (lines 195, 206)
- The playbook now only verifies CNI on Debian nodes (masternode, storagenodet3500)

**File: `deploy.sh`**
- Updated `verify_debian_cluster_health()` function to only check Debian nodes
- Now explicitly filters for `(masternode|storagenodet3500)` when checking node health
- No longer attempts to verify homelab as part of Debian cluster health checks

### 2. Added Non-Interactive Mode Support

**File: `deploy.sh`**
- All `ansible-playbook` commands now accept `skip_ansible_confirm=true` parameter when `--yes` flag is used
- Commands affected:
  - `cmd_debian()` - Debian deployment
  - `cmd_rke2()` - RKE2 deployment  
  - `cmd_reset()` - Cluster reset
  - `cmd_setup_autosleep()` - Auto-sleep setup
  - RKE2 uninstall in reset

**File: `ansible/playbooks/reset-cluster.yaml`**
- Modified confirmation prompt to be conditional
- When `skip_ansible_confirm` is defined and true:
  - Skips the interactive `pause` task
  - Automatically sets confirmation to 'yes'
- Maintains backward compatibility for interactive use

### 3. Enabled Color-Coded Output

**File: `deploy.sh`**
- Set `ANSIBLE_FORCE_COLOR=true` for all ansible-playbook commands
- Ensures colored output even when piping to `tee` for logging
- Affected commands:
  - debian deployment
  - rke2 installation
  - reset operations
  - setup commands
  - spindown operations

### 4. Improved Dry-Run Output

**File: `deploy.sh`**
- Enhanced `--check` output to show actual commands that would be executed
- Displays `skip_ansible_confirm=true` when `--yes` flag is used
- More accurate representation of what will run

### 5. Better Error Handling

**File: `deploy.sh`**
- Changed from simple `if` checks to capturing `PIPESTATUS[0]`
- Allows proper exit code detection even with pipes
- More reliable error reporting

## Testing

### New Test Suite
**File: `tests/test-yes-flag.sh`**
- Tests that `--yes` flag properly passes `skip_ansible_confirm=true`
- Tests that without `--yes` flag, no skip parameter is added
- Tests colored output configuration
- Covers debian, rke2, reset, and all commands

### Existing Tests
**File: `tests/test-deploy-limits.sh`**
- All existing tests continue to pass
- Validates that debian command never targets homelab
- Validates proper playbook selection for each command

## Usage Examples

### Deploy Debian cluster without prompts:
```bash
./deploy.sh debian --yes
```

### Deploy both clusters non-interactively:
```bash
./deploy.sh all --with-rke2 --yes
```

### Reset everything without confirmations:
```bash
./deploy.sh reset --yes
```

### Dry-run to see what would execute:
```bash
./deploy.sh debian --check --yes
```

## Benefits

1. **Automation-Friendly**: Can now run deployments in CI/CD pipelines without hanging on prompts
2. **Cleaner Separation**: Debian deployment truly isolated from homelab node
3. **Better UX**: Color-coded Ansible output makes it easier to spot issues
4. **Safer**: Dry-run mode shows exactly what will execute including all parameters
5. **Reliable**: Proper error handling ensures failures are detected correctly

## Backward Compatibility

All changes maintain backward compatibility:
- Scripts work with or without `--yes` flag
- Interactive prompts still work when `--yes` is not specified
- Existing workflows remain unchanged
- Only behavior change: Debian cluster health checks no longer include homelab
