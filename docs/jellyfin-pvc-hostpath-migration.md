# VMStation Jellyfin PVC Fix - Implementation Summary

## Problem Statement
The VMStation deployment was experiencing two critical issues:

1. **Jellyfin CrashLoopBackOff**: Jellyfin pods were failing to start due to PVC (PersistentVolumeClaim) configuration issues
2. **kube-proxy CrashLoopBackOff**: The kube-proxy pod on the homelab node (192.168.4.62) was failing repeatedly

The user specifically requested removal of PVC dependencies since they handle all directories and files manually for their media server and want to avoid ansible errors that could destroy data.

## Root Cause Analysis
- The Jellyfin deployment was using PVC-based storage which required complex PV/PVC setup and matching
- The verification and bootstrap scripts were inconsistent in their approach to Jellyfin deployment
- Post-deployment fixes existed but were not integrated into the main deployment flow
- Health checks were using incorrect endpoints

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Removed PVC Dependencies from Jellyfin
**File**: `manifests/jellyfin/jellyfin.yaml`
- **Before**: Used Deployment + PVC + PV resources (complex setup)
- **After**: Uses Pod + hostPath volumes (direct host directory mounting)

**Changes**:
- Removed all PersistentVolume and PersistentVolumeClaim resources
- Changed from Deployment to Pod for simpler management
- Direct hostPath volumes: 
  - Config: `/var/lib/jellyfin` (DirectoryOrCreate)
  - Media: `/srv/media` (DirectoryOrCreate)
  - Cache: `emptyDir` (temporary, no persistence needed)

### 2. Fixed Health Check Endpoints
**Files**: `manifests/jellyfin/jellyfin.yaml`, `ansible/playbooks/verify-cluster.yml`
- **Before**: Used `/health` endpoint (incorrect/unreliable)
- **After**: Uses `/` endpoint (better compatibility with Jellyfin startup)

**Benefits**:
- Startup probe: 30 attempts × 10s = 5 minutes startup time allowance
- Readiness probe: More frequent checks (30s intervals)
- Liveness probe: Conservative failure threshold (5 failures before restart)

### 3. Integrated Post-Deployment Fixes
**File**: `deploy-cluster.sh`
- Added `run_post_deployment_fixes()` function
- Automatically runs existing fix scripts after deployment:
  - `scripts/fix_homelab_node_issues.sh` (handles kube-proxy CrashLoopBackOff)
  - `scripts/fix_remaining_pod_issues.sh` (handles various pod issues)
- Includes automatic cleanup of conflicting PVC resources
- Works both locally and remotely via SSH

### 4. Improved Service Configuration
**File**: `manifests/jellyfin/jellyfin.yaml`
- Updated service name to `jellyfin-service` for consistency
- Fixed selector labels to match Pod labels
- Maintained NodePort configuration (30096, 30920)

## Technical Benefits

### Simplified Storage Management
```yaml
# OLD (PVC-based)
volumes:
- name: jellyfin-config
  persistentVolumeClaim:
    claimName: jellyfin-config-pvc

# NEW (hostPath-based)  
volumes:
- name: jellyfin-config
  hostPath:
    path: /var/lib/jellyfin
    type: DirectoryOrCreate
```

### Automatic Issue Resolution
The deploy-cluster.sh script now:
1. Deploys the cluster
2. Automatically cleans up any conflicting PVC resources
3. Runs specialized fix scripts for known issues
4. Reports success/failure for each component

### Better Error Handling
- Non-critical failures in fix scripts don't stop deployment
- Comprehensive logging and status reporting
- Graceful handling of both local and remote execution scenarios

## Files Modified

1. **`manifests/jellyfin/jellyfin.yaml`** - Complete rewrite from PVC to hostPath
2. **`ansible/playbooks/verify-cluster.yml`** - Fixed health check endpoint
3. **`deploy-cluster.sh`** - Added post-deployment fixes integration

## Validation Results

All validations pass:
- ✅ No PVC dependencies remaining
- ✅ Correct hostPath volume configuration
- ✅ Pod-based deployment (simpler than Deployment)
- ✅ Correct health check endpoints
- ✅ Post-deployment fixes integrated
- ✅ Automatic PVC cleanup included
- ✅ Script syntax and YAML structure validated

## Expected Outcome

After these changes:
1. **Jellyfin should start successfully** without PVC-related errors
2. **kube-proxy issues should be automatically resolved** by post-deployment fixes
3. **Deployment should be more reliable** with simplified storage and automatic issue resolution
4. **User has full control** over directory management without PVC interference

## Usage

```bash
# Standard deployment (includes all fixes)
./deploy-cluster.sh deploy

# Simple deployment without comprehensive setup
./deploy-cluster.sh --simple deploy

# Dry run to see what would be done
./deploy-cluster.sh --dry-run deploy

# Run only verification (includes fixes)
./deploy-cluster.sh verify
```

The deployment will now automatically handle the issues reported in the problem statement without requiring manual intervention.
