echo "   runAsGroup: 1000     # Consistent with volume permissions"
echo "   fsGroup: 1000        # Ensures proper file access"
echo
echo "2. Volume Permissions (automatically ensured):"
echo "   /var/lib/jellyfin ‚Üí owner 1000:1000, mode 755"
echo "   /srv/media       ‚Üí owner 1000:1000, mode 755"
echo
echo "3. Resource Optimization:"
echo "   CPU: 500m-2000m      # Balanced for 4K transcoding"
echo "   Memory: 512Mi-2Gi    # Sufficient for media streaming"
echo

# Show the deployment workflow
echo "üöÄ DEPLOYMENT WORKFLOW:"
echo
echo "1. Run: ./fix_jellyfin_readiness.sh"
echo "   ‚Üí Detects incorrect probe configuration"
echo "   ‚Üí Safely replaces pod with correct config"
echo "   ‚Üí Ensures volume permissions"
echo "   ‚Üí Waits for pod readiness"
echo
echo "2. Run: ./test_jellyfin_config.sh"
echo "   ‚Üí Validates probe paths are correct"
echo "   ‚Üí Confirms security context"
echo "   ‚Üí Checks pod status"
echo
echo "3. Access: http://192.168.4.61:30096"
echo "   ‚Üí Jellyfin web interface should be available"
echo "   ‚Üí Pod status: 1/1 Ready"
echo

echo "üìã SUMMARY:"
echo "The fix addresses the root cause: incorrect probe endpoints"
echo "All configurations now consistently use the correct '/' path"
echo "Volume permissions are automatically managed"
echo "Security is improved with non-root execution"
echo
echo "Ready to deploy! The solution is complete and validated."
