# VMStation Kubernetes Migration - Implementation Complete

## Overview

VMStation has been successfully rewritten to use Kubernetes as the primary infrastructure platform, replacing the previous Podman-based setup. The monitoring_nodes (192.168.4.63) now acts as the Kubernetes control plane, issuing TLS certificates to other machines and managing a comprehensive monitoring stack.

## Implementation Summary

### ✅ Requirements Met

1. **Kubernetes Cluster Setup**
   - monitoring_nodes (192.168.4.63) configured as control plane
   - storage_nodes and compute_nodes configured as worker nodes
   - Full cluster automation with kubeadm and containerd

2. **TLS Certificate Management**
   - cert-manager installed for automated certificate lifecycle
   - Self-signed CA for internal communications
   - Individual certificates for all monitoring services

3. **Helm Application Management**
   - Helm 3 installed on control plane
   - Multiple repositories configured (prometheus-community, grafana, jetstack)
   - Application deployments fully automated

4. **Enhanced Monitoring Stack**
   - Prometheus with persistent storage and 30-day retention
   - Grafana with enhanced dashboards and NodePort access
   - Loki for centralized log aggregation
   - AlertManager for comprehensive alerting

5. **SSH Connectivity Preserved**
   - Existing SSH key setup maintained
   - All playbooks use established connection methods
