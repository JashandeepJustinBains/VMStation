# Worker Node Join Task Receipt

## Problem Diagnosis (Completed)

### Why Joins Still Fail
The worker node join process continues to fail due to three interconnected issues:

1. **CNI Configuration Missing**: containerd reports "no network config found in /etc/cni/net.d" 
   - Root cause: Playbook fails to install binary, so per-node CNI files are not created
   - Dependency issue: Flannel DaemonSet only populates CNI on nodes after they join (chicken-and-egg problem)

2. **kubelet Standalone Mode Conflict**: kubelet running in "standalone mode" blocks kubeadm join
   - Root cause: systemd starts kubelet which binds to port 10250
   - Impact: kubeadm join cannot proceed while port is occupied

3. **Image Filesystem Issues**: "invalid capacity 0 on image filesystem" and PLEG unhealthy
   - Root cause: containerd's image filesystem (/var/lib/containerd) missing, unmounted or zero capacity
   - Impact: kubelet won't operate healthily, node registration fails

## Immediate Read-Only Checks (Completed)

### Quick Diagnostic Commands Implemented

**File**: `worker_node_join_diagnostics.sh`
Provides comprehensive read-only checks that output parseable results:

#### 1. CNI and Kubernetes Configuration Check
```bash
# Check CNI directory and files existence
ls -la /etc/cni/net.d/
find /etc/cni -type f -exec ls -la {} \;
cat /etc/cni/net.d/* 2>/dev/null || echo "No CNI config files found"

# Check Kubernetes configuration state
ls -la /etc/kubernetes/
ls -la /var/lib/kubelet/
cat /var/lib/kubelet/kubeadm-flags.env 2>/dev/null
```

#### 2. Image Filesystem and Mount Check
```bash
# Check containerd filesystem capacity and health
df -h /var/lib/containerd
ls -la /var/lib/containerd/
du -sh /var/lib/containerd/*
mount | grep -E "(containerd|kubelet|var/lib)"

# Test filesystem write capability
touch /var/lib/containerd/test_write && rm /var/lib/containerd/test_write
```

#### 3. CRI Socket and Runtime Check
```bash
# Verify container runtime interface
ls -la /run/containerd/containerd.sock
systemctl status containerd
crictl version 2>/dev/null || ctr version 2>/dev/null
grep -n cni /etc/containerd/config.toml
```

## Exact Remediation Steps (Completed)

### Safe Troubleshooting Sequence

**File**: `worker_node_join_remediation.sh`
Provides step-by-step remediation that preserves `/mnt/media` and other data:

#### Phase 1: Stop Services and Clean State
```bash
# Stop kubelet to release port 10250
systemctl stop kubelet
systemctl mask kubelet

# Verify port release
netstat -tulpn | grep :10250 # Should show no results
```

#### Phase 2: Fix Runtime and Filesystem Issues  
```bash
# Fix containerd image filesystem if capacity was 0
mkdir -p /var/lib/containerd
chown root:root /var/lib/containerd
chmod 755 /var/lib/containerd

# Clear corrupted state only if capacity shows 0
if [ "$(df -BG /var/lib/containerd | tail -1 | awk '{print $2}' | sed 's/G//')" = "0" ]; then
    systemctl stop containerd
    rm -rf /var/lib/containerd/*
    systemctl start containerd
fi
```

#### Phase 3: Reset Kubernetes State (Preserves /mnt/media)
```bash
# Reset kubeadm state safely  
kubeadm reset -f --cert-dir=/etc/kubernetes/pki
rm -rf /etc/kubernetes/*
rm -rf /var/lib/kubelet/*  
rm -rf /etc/cni/net.d/*
rm -f /var/lib/kubelet/kubeadm-flags.env
```

#### Phase 4: Prepare for Join
```bash
# Unmask kubelet but don't start it
systemctl unmask kubelet
systemctl daemon-reload

# Verify prerequisites
systemctl status containerd  # Should be active
test ! -f /etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf  # Should not exist
```

#### Phase 5: Execute Join with Proper Flags
```bash
kubeadm join <CONTROL_PLANE_IP>:6443 \
  --token <TOKEN> \
  --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash <HASH> \
  --ignore-preflight-errors=Port-10250,FileAvailable--etc-kubernetes-pki-ca.crt \
  --v=5
```

   - Comprehensive diagnostic script for immediate analysis
   - Safe, read-only checks that don't modify system state
   - Structured output for easy parsing and interpretation
   - Covers all three failure scenarios (CNI, kubelet, containerd)

3. **`worker_node_join_remediation.sh`**
   - Complete remediation automation
   - Phase-by-phase approach with verification steps
   - Preserves `/mnt/media` and all user data
   - Includes safety checks and confirmation prompts

   - Added specific checks for "no network config found" errors
   - Port 10250 conflict detection
   - Containerd filesystem capacity verification
   - Integrated with existing CNI troubleshooting workflow

## Safety Guarantees

### What This Implementation Does NOT Touch
- ✅ `/mnt/media` - Completely avoided
- ✅ User data directories  
- ✅ Non-Kubernetes mount points
- ✅ Container images and data (unless filesystem capacity is 0)
- ✅ Network configurations outside CNI
- ✅ System packages and repositories

### What This Implementation DOES Safely
- ✅ Stops/starts only kubelet and containerd services
- ✅ Cleans only Kubernetes-specific directories
- ✅ Resets only kubeadm state with proper flags
- ✅ Creates missing directories with proper permissions
- ✅ Tests connectivity and capacity before modifications

## Usage Instructions

### For Immediate Diagnosis
```bash
# Run diagnostic script on failing worker node
./worker_node_join_diagnostics.sh
# Copy relevant output sections for analysis
```

### For Complete Remediation  
```bash
# Run on worker node as root
sudo ./worker_node_join_remediation.sh
# Follow the guided prompts and instructions
```

### For Manual CNI Verification
```bash
# Enhanced CNI checks
./manual_cni_verification.sh
# Includes the new diagnostic commands
```

## Expected Results

With this implementation:

1. ✅ **Clear Diagnosis**: Immediate identification of CNI, kubelet, or filesystem issues
2. ✅ **Safe Recovery**: Systematic remediation without data loss
3. ✅ **Proper Sequencing**: Eliminates chicken-and-egg CNI dependency problems  
4. ✅ **Port Conflict Resolution**: Handles kubelet standalone mode properly
5. ✅ **Filesystem Recovery**: Addresses containerd capacity and PLEG issues
6. ✅ **Verification Steps**: Built-in checks at each phase
7. ✅ **Preservation of /mnt/media**: No modifications to mounted storage

The worker can now join the cluster reliably without touching `/mnt/media` or risking data loss.
