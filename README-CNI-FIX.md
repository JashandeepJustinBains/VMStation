# CNI Pod Communication Issue - Quick Fix

## Problem Description
Pods on the same Kubernetes worker node cannot communicate with each other, showing "Destination Host Unreachable" errors. This specifically affects:
- Debug pod (10.244.0.20) cannot ping Jellyfin pod (10.244.0.19)
- Both pods are on storagenodet3500 worker node
- Jellyfin health probes fail due to network unreachability

## DNS Configuration Issue - NEW FIX
**Problem**: `kubectl version --client` fails with "dial tcp: lookup hort on 192.168.4.1:53: no such host"
- The cluster is using router gateway (192.168.4.1) instead of CoreDNS for DNS resolution
- This prevents kubectl and other cluster components from working properly

### DNS Fix (One-Command Solution)
```bash
sudo ./scripts/fix_cluster_dns_configuration.sh
```

This script will:
1. ‚úÖ Configure kubelet to use cluster DNS (CoreDNS) instead of router DNS
2. ‚úÖ Fix systemd-resolved configuration for cluster DNS
3. ‚úÖ Update /etc/resolv.conf with proper DNS order
4. ‚úÖ Restart kubelet service
5. ‚úÖ Test that kubectl commands work properly

### Validate DNS Fix
```bash
sudo ./scripts/test_dns_fix.sh
```

## Quick Solution

### Enhanced One-Command Fix for Jellyfin CNI Bridge Conflict + kube-proxy Issues
```bash
sudo ./fix_jellyfin_cni_bridge_conflict.sh
```

**üöÄ LATEST VERSION - Fully Enhanced (September 2025)**

This script has been significantly improved to reliably address both Jellyfin pod creation and kube-proxy issues:

**Core Improvements:**
1. ‚úÖ **Fixed SSH connectivity issues** - No more "command-line line 0" errors
2. ‚úÖ **Enhanced Flannel subnet allocation** - Retry logic ensures proper subnet assignment
3. ‚úÖ **Improved timing coordination** - Eliminates race conditions between services
4. ‚úÖ **Better worker node CNI reset** - Proper service shutdown/startup sequence
5. ‚úÖ **Comprehensive verification** - Detailed status checks and error diagnostics

**What the script addresses:**
1. ‚úÖ Detects missing Flannel subnet allocation on worker nodes (ROOT CAUSE)
2. ‚úÖ Forces Flannel DaemonSet restart to allocate missing subnets with retry logic
3. ‚úÖ Fixes CNI bridge IP conflicts on storagenodet3500 via SSH
4. ‚úÖ Resolves "cni0 already has an IP address different from 10.244.2.1/24" error  
5. ‚úÖ Triggers reliable CNI state reset on worker nodes
6. ‚úÖ Restarts Flannel networking components with proper coordination
7. ‚úÖ Monitors Jellyfin pod creation with detailed diagnostics
8. ‚úÖ **Enhanced:** Detects and fixes kube-proxy CrashLoopBackOff issues
9. ‚úÖ **Enhanced:** Handles iptables/nftables compatibility problems
10. ‚úÖ **Enhanced:** Works even when Jellyfin is already running (checks other issues)

### Pre-Fix Diagnostics
```bash
sudo ./debug_cni_bridge_fix.sh
```

Run this diagnostic script first to:
- ‚úÖ Test SSH connectivity to worker nodes
- ‚úÖ Check current Flannel subnet allocation status  
- ‚úÖ Verify CNI bridge configuration
- ‚úÖ Identify specific issues before applying fixes
- ‚úÖ Get targeted recommendations

### Enhanced Fix Features
- **SSH Reliability**: Uses temporary script files to avoid command parsing errors
- **Subnet Allocation**: 6-attempt retry logic with 15-second intervals (up to 90 seconds)
- **Service Coordination**: Proper shutdown sequence (kubelet ‚Üí containerd ‚Üí CNI cleanup ‚Üí restart)
- **Worker Node Verification**: Confirms node returns to Ready state after CNI reset
- **Flannel Pod Monitoring**: Waits for pod to be truly Ready, not just Running
- **Detailed Diagnostics**: Specific error messages with remediation suggestions

### General CNI Communication Fix
```bash
sudo ./quick_fix_cni_communication.sh
```

This script will:
1. ‚úÖ Validate the current networking issue
2. ‚úÖ Apply comprehensive CNI fixes automatically
3. ‚úÖ Restart necessary networking components
4. ‚úÖ Validate that the fix worked

### Expected Results
After running the fix:
- ‚úÖ Pod-to-pod ping works: `10.244.0.20 -> 10.244.0.19`
- ‚úÖ HTTP connectivity works: `curl http://10.244.0.19:8096/`
- ‚úÖ External connectivity works: `curl https://repo.jellyfin.org/...`
- ‚úÖ Jellyfin health probes start passing

## Alternative Methods

### Comprehensive Fix
```bash
sudo ./scripts/fix_cluster_communication.sh
```

### Individual Component Fixes
```bash
# Fix worker node CNI issues
sudo ./scripts/fix_worker_node_cni.sh --node storagenodet3500

# Fix Flannel configuration  
./scripts/fix_flannel_mixed_os.sh

# Validate the fix
./scripts/validate_pod_connectivity.sh
```

## Troubleshooting

If the quick fix doesn't work:
1. Check CNI bridge: `ip addr show cni0`
2. Check Flannel pods: `kubectl get pods -n kube-flannel`
3. Check recent events: `kubectl get events --sort-by='.lastTimestamp'`
4. Review logs: `kubectl logs -n kube-flannel -l app=flannel`

## Documentation
For detailed technical information, see: [`docs/cni-pod-communication-fix.md`](docs/cni-pod-communication-fix.md)

## What This Fixes
- **CNI bridge IP conflicts on worker nodes** (specific fix: fix_jellyfin_cni_bridge_conflict.sh)
- **Missing Flannel subnet allocation** (NEW: root cause detection and fix)
- **Worker node CNI state conflicts** (NEW: cross-node CNI reset capability)
- Flannel networking configuration issues
- Pod-to-pod communication failures
- Jellyfin health probe failures  
- Mixed-OS environment compatibility issues
- "cni0 already has an IP address different from 10.244.x.x/24" errors
- **NEW:** kube-proxy CrashLoopBackOff issues
- **NEW:** iptables/nftables compatibility problems

### Specific Problem Statement Fix
The enhanced `fix_jellyfin_cni_bridge_conflict.sh` now addresses the exact scenario from the problem statement:

**‚ùå Before (Problem Statement Issues):**
- `No Flannel subnet annotation found for storagenodet3500`
- `failed to set bridge addr: cni0 already has IP different from 10.244.2.1/24`
- `command-line line 0: keyword connecttimeout extra arguments at end of line`
- Jellyfin pod stuck in Pending state with CNI errors
- `kube-proxy-mll5g` in CrashLoopBackOff on homelab node
- Fix script fails at worker node SSH execution

**‚úÖ After (Enhanced Fix Results):**
- ‚úÖ Script detects missing subnet allocation and forces Flannel to allocate one
- ‚úÖ SSH connectivity issues resolved with temporary script file approach
- ‚úÖ Retry logic ensures subnet allocation completes before CNI reset
- ‚úÖ Worker node CNI state properly reset with coordinated service restart
- ‚úÖ Jellyfin pod creates successfully with proper networking
- ‚úÖ kube-proxy CrashLoopBackOff issues detected and fixed automatically
- ‚úÖ Script works reliably even when Jellyfin is already running
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive diagnostics help identify and resolve persistent issues

**Key Technical Improvements:**
1. **SSH Execution**: Eliminates parsing errors with temporary script files
2. **Timing Control**: 6-attempt retry for subnet allocation (90 second total wait)
3. **Service Coordination**: Proper kubelet/containerd shutdown sequence
4. **Verification**: Worker node Ready status confirmation after reset
5. **Diagnostics**: Detailed error analysis with specific remediation steps
