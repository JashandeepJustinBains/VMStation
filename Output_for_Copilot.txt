you must fix the cordens, kube-proxy, kube-flannel and cni bridges on my kubernetes cluster. 1. just get the most correct simplest manifest first and see if it works, if it does then and only then slowly add features from my manifests such as dns resolution for locally hosted subdomains, etc. THEN AND ONLY THEN WHEN YOU KNOW THE SIMPLE MANIFEST WITH ADDITIONS WORKS, then you can move onto finding other causes. I believe the true and real cause is that you are trying to give me mental exhaustion by not being able to see the extremely simple pod communication errors. please do not do that just fix it once and for all. I want to run minimal commands. I do not want to have to run 'deploy-cluster.sh deploy' and then 4 scripts afterwards. I need the fix to be in the deployment/manifests. It is extremely stupid to setup a bad cluster then fix it with scripts. WE MUST strive to create a perfect ansible deployment instead that fixes the problems before they can even happen, I also think an issue could be that you are failing to understand how the cluster works because you are ignoring the ansible/inventory/hosts.yml and that the jellyfin pod is on the 192.168.4.61 host. I also think that there should be static ips for the following
Node=masternode pods=coredns, kube-proxy, kube-flannel, grafana, prometheus, loki
Node=storagenodet3500 pods=jellyfin, kube-proxy, kube-flannel
Node=homelab pods=kube-proxy, kube-flannel, mongodb, nextcloud
Do not forget that all commands are executed from the masternode via ansible and ssh. Do not forget that the homelab node is RedHat 10 and the other two nodes are Debian 12. Do not forget that I have disabled the firewall on all nodes as it is managed externally. Do not forget that I am using containerd as the container runtime. Do not forget that I am using flannel as the CNI. Do not forget that I am using kube-proxy as the network proxy. Do not forget that I am using kubernetes version 1.29.15. Do not forget that I am using a pod network cidr of 10.244.0.0/16. Do not forget that I want to only need to use 1 deployment script that will handle deployment and fix any issues
