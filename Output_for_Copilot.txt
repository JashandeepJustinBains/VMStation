I'm going to read your Output_for_Copilot.txt to extract the kubelet, containerd, flannel, nft/iptables, and kube-proxy logs so I can confirm root causes and any remaining action items. I'll read the file now and summarize key findings.

I'm going to add a final play to fix-homelab-crashloop.yml that collects host-level diagnostics (kubelet, containerd journals, nftables, iptables, dmesg, and /run/flannel/subnet.env) from `homelab` for future troubleshooting; outcome: automated capture printed in the playbook output. 

Using "Apply Patch"


```

```
Progress update: I added an automated diagnostics collection play to fix-homelab-crashloop.yml so future runs will capture `kubelet`/`containerd` journals, nftables/iptables state, dmesg, and Flannel's subnet file from `homelab`. This will make troubleshooting on future failures fast and reproducible.

Why I added this
- Your Output_for_Copilot.txt shows a history of sandbox restarts and container exit codes (some exits 137, some 2) with frequent pod sandbox teardown and network teardown events. Capturing host logs and rulesets immediately after a failure will let us see whether kubelet is killing pods because CNI is toggling, permissions (SELinux) are denying actions, or packet-filtering rules are missing.

What changed
- File updated: fix-homelab-crashloop.yml
  - Added a final play (hosts: homelab) that runs as root and prints:
    - last 200 lines of `journalctl -u kubelet`
    - last 200 lines of `journalctl -u containerd`
    - `nft list ruleset`
    - `iptables-save -c`
    - `dmesg` tail
    - contents of `/run/flannel/subnet.env` (if present)

How to use it
- Re-run the wrapper script when you next see kube-proxy/flannel instability:
```bash
cd /srv/monitoring_data/VMStation
git pull
chmod +x scripts/fix-homelab-crashloop.sh
./scripts/fix-homelab-crashloop.sh
```
- The playbook will run the fixes and then print these diagnostics; paste the diagnostics here if anything still fails and I'll analyze them.

Immediate observations from your pasted logs (high level)
- containerd shows many pod sandboxes being created and then tear down; many containers exit with status 137 (killed), and some kube-proxy exits with code 2 — these align with the prior root-cause hypothesis where Flannel/CNI timing and nftables/iptables differences caused transient state changes that made kubelet recreate sandboxes.
- After applying the fixes, many pods are Running and you confirmed `ping 10.244.0.1` works. That indicates Flannel successfully established networking.
- The diagnostic play will help if kube-proxy or flannel re-flap so we can observe the exact host-level errors at the moment of failure.

Next steps (pick one)
- Option A: Wait and monitor; if kube-proxy or flannel start failing again, re-run the wrapper and paste the output — I’ll analyze it immediately.
- Option B: I can increase kube-proxy logging verbosity in the DaemonSet temporarily (add --v=4), run the rollout, and gather logs proactively. I recommend this only if failures reoccur and logs are inconclusive.

If you want Option B, say so and I’ll patch the DaemonSet manifest and add an idempotent Ansible task to trigger the rollout and collect extra logs.

Made changes.
